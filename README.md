This is the place for me to play around with new concepts and features. It's just adding a bit of structure to what I had on my local machine, nothing fancy.

Things I'd like to try:

- [ ] running a local recommendation model in my obsidian vault
- [ ] writing a cli in go
- [ ] more work on view transitions in html/css
- a bunch of other things
